Project Description:

This script is designed to analyze stock data for each quarter and output useful information such as:

1. Ticker symbol for each stock.

2. Quarterly change: The change in stock price from the opening price at the beginning of the quarter to the closing price at the end of the quarter.

3. Percentage change: The percentage change from the opening price to the closing price.

4. Total stock volume: Calculated as the volume of shares traded multiplied by the closing price.

5. Greatest % increase: The stock with the greatest percentage increase over the quarter.

6. Greatest % decrease: The stock with the greatest percentage decrease over the quarter.

7. Greatest total volume: The stock with the highest total volume for the quarter.

This script processes stock data in an Excel sheet and generates the output, while also applying color-coding for the quarterly changes.
