# VBA Stock Market Analysis Challenge 📊💰
## Overview 🎯
This project is all about diving into stock market data using VBA scripting in Excel. The goal? Automate the analysis of stock performance across multiple quarters to identify trends, highlight key stats, and make Excel do all the heavy lifting for us. No more manual calculations! 🚀
## What I Did 🛠️
I wrote a VBA script that loops through stock data for each quarter and extracts the following insights:
- Ticker Symbol 
- Quarterly Change: Difference between the opening and closing price per quarter
- Percentage Change: Percent difference between the opening and closing price
- Total Stock Volume: Sum of shares traded over the quarter 
To make this even more insightful, I added functionality to identify:
- Greatest % Increase
- Greatest % Decrease
- Greatest Total Volume
### Bonus Features ✨
- Conditional Formatting: Green for positive changes, red for negative changes
- Multi-Sheet Processing: The script runs on every worksheet (aka every quarter) with a single execution
- Performance Optimization: Used a smaller dataset (alphabetical_testing.xlsx) to develop and test the script for faster iteration
## How It Works ⚙️
1. The script loops through each stock and extracts the relevant data.
2. It calculates quarterly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volume.
3. It highlights biggest winners and losers in terms of stock performance.
4. Applies conditional formatting to make trends stand out visually.
5. Runs the analysis across all worksheets seamlessly.
## Key Learnings 📚
- Mastered looping through rows and multiple worksheets in VBA
- Applied conditional formatting dynamically
- Learned how to work with large datasets efficiently
- Automated data extraction and analysis for better insights

This project was a great way to sharpen my VBA skills and automate real-world data analysis. On to the next challenge! 💪🔥
